Create a 1/50 scale handmade model of this building in balsa wood with realistic structures and environments. Place the handmade model on the computer desk, using a square wooden base without any text, and there are tools for making handmade models and some wood chips on the computer desk. On the computer screen, the modeling process using the Rhino3D modeling software is displayed. Next to the computer screen, place a photorealistic model box with a photo of the handmade model.

A cinematic slow pan across a beautifully detailed balsa wood architectural model of a futuristic, organic building. The model sits on a cluttered architect's desk with crafting tools, glue, and wood shavings scattered around. In the background, a computer monitor glows, displaying a photorealistic render of the same design. The scene is lit with warm, dramatic lighting, with a shallow depth of field focusing on the intricate details of the model. Moody and atmospheric.
